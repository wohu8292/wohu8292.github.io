          <p>
            Darvish is a right-handed pitcher who throws from a three-quarter
            arm slot in a drop-and-drive motion. He has a large frame for a
            pitcher, listed at 6 ft 5 in and 220 lb. Darvish throws a four-seam
            fastball which averages 93–95 mph (tops out at 99 mph), as well as a
            hard slurve (slider) in the low 80s with a sharp break. He
            complements these two with a wide repertoire of secondary pitches,
            including a two-seam fastball (also described as a shuuto), a
            cutter, two curveballs, a splitter, and an occasional changeup.
            Darvish has a "fast curve" and a "slow curve", the former averaging
            about 80 mph and the latter about 71. The slow curve is almost
            exclusively used in no-strike and 1-strike counts, while the fast
            curve is mostly used in 2-strike counts. Some professional scouts
            consider Darvish to have the best repertoire of quality pitches,
            including the best slider, in all of Major League Baseball. In
            August 2019, Darvish learned a knuckle curve from Cubs teammate
            Craig Kimbrel and began using the pitch. Advance scouting on Darvish
            is made difficult by his tendency to change his most frequent pitch
            sequences over time. While Darvish uses both the set, or "stretch"
            position and the windup, he has been noted for pitching exclusively
            from the stretch at times, even when there is no one on base. While
            pitching from the windup is generally thought to add velocity to
            pitches, the set position allows pitchers more control over
            baserunners. In Darvish's case the set position often is used as a
            way of keeping his delivery in sync and consistent. Prior to the
            2006 season Darvish's "go-to" pitch was a screwball, and he tends to
            rely more on his off-speed pitches than his fastball. After injuring
            his shoulder in an exhibition game start against the 2006 World
            Baseball Classic Japanese national team in February 2006, because of
            the strain the screwball had gradually been putting on his shoulder,
            he took the pitch out of his in-game repertoire and worked to
            develop his splitter until it became an equally effective pitch that
            would replace the screwball.

            Darvish was posted to Major League Baseball prior to the 2012
            season,[49] and is currently represented by agents Don Nomura and
            Arn Tellem. He added confirmation of this posting on his blog.[50]
            MLB teams had until 14 December 2011 to submit a blind posting bid,
            and the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters had until 20 December 2011 to
            announce whether the highest bid would be accepted or rejected.
            Their announcement of acceptance of the highest bid, from the Texas
            Rangers, was made on 19 December 2011 EST, at a reported $51.7
            million. The Rangers then had 30 days to negotiate with Darvish, or
            he would return to Japan.[51] On 18 January 2012, the Texas Rangers
            signed Darvish to a $60M dollar contract for six years with a player
            option to void the last year, fifteen minutes prior to a 4:00pm CST
            deadline. Rangers CEO Nolan Ryan commented that Darvish had shown
            more control than he did at Darvish's age.

        <section class="content">
          <p>
            On 31 July 2017, the Rangers traded Darvish to the Los Angeles
            Dodgers for prospects Willie Calhoun, A. J. Alexy, and Brendon
            Davis.[73] He was 4–3 with a 3.44 ERA in nine starts for the
            Dodgers.[74] Overall in 2017, combined with both teams, Darvish made
            31 starts with a 10–12 record, 209 strikeouts, 12 wild pitches (7th
            in the major leagues), and a 3.86 ERA.[75] In the postseason, he won
            his one start in the 2017 NLDS, allowing one run in five innings
            against the Arizona Diamondbacks while striking out seven. He also
            pitched well in the 2017 NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, with one run
            in 61⁄3 innings with also seven strikeouts.

        <section class="content">
          <p>
            On February 13, 2018, Darvish signed a six-year, $126 million
            contract with the Chicago Cubs.[82] He played his first game with
            the Cubs on 31 March 2018, against the Miami Marlins. He allowed 5
            runs in 4+1⁄3 innings as the Cubs won 10–6 in 10 innings.[83] On 7
            May, Darvish was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to the
            flu.[84] On 26 May, Darvish was again placed on the 10-day disabled
            list due to right triceps tendinitis.[85] On 19 August 2018, Darvish
            began a rehab stint. While warming up before the second inning,
            Darvish summoned trainers and was removed from the game.[86] An MRI
            revealed Darvish had a stress reaction on his right elbow as well as
            a triceps strain, ending his 2018 season,[87] after only 8 games and
            40 innings pitched, in which he was 1–3 with a 4.95 ERA.[75] Darvish
            in 2019 for the Cubs was 6–8 with a 3.98 ERA and 225 strikeouts in
            31 starts.[88] He gave up 33 home runs, the most in the National
            League, threw 11 wild pitches, the second-most in the NL, and hit 11
            batsmen, third-most in the league.[89] In the pandemic-shortened
            2020 season, Darvish was 8–3 with a 2.01 ERA.[75] He led the
            National League in wins, was second in ERA, walks per nine innings
            pitched (1.658), and home runs per nine innings pitched (0.592),
            fourth in WHIP (0.961), fifth in won-loss percentage (.727), seventh
            in hits per nine innings pitched (6.987), and eighth in strikeouts
            per nine innings pitched (11.013).[90]

          <p>
            On 29 December 2020, Darvish along with personal catcher Víctor
            Caratini were traded to the San Diego Padres in exchange for pitcher
            Zach Davies and four prospects ahead of the 2021 season.[91] In his
            first year with the Padres, Darvish posted an 8–11 record with a
            4.22 ERA and 199 strikeouts in 166+1⁄3 innings. He was also named to
            his fifth All-Star team.[92] The following season, Darvish threw his
            3,000th career strikeout on 2 September 2022, becoming only the
            second pitcher after Hideo Nomo to reach the milestone.[93]

          I am a professor of Information Science at Cornell Tech where I lead
          the Social Technologies research group. Previously, I was an assistant
          professor at Rutgers SC&I, led a research team at Yahoo! Research
          Berkeley, and got a PhD from Stanford. Oh, and played professional
          basketball. I sometimes consult or even co-found startups. My lab
          designs, builds, and studies social systems, with a focus on topics
          related to Technology, Media and Democracy and the trustworthiness of
          our information ecosystem. Our sponsors include Yahoo, Google,
          Facebook and the National Science Foundation. For prospective PhD

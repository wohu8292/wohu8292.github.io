    <h1>hello</h1>
    <p>
      I am a professor of Information Science at Cornell Tech where I lead the
      Social Technologies research group. Previously, I was an assistant
      professor at Rutgers SC&I, led a research team at Yahoo! Research
      Berkeley, and got a PhD from Stanford. Oh, and played professional
      basketball. I sometimes consult or even co-found startups. My lab designs,
      builds, and studies social systems, with a focus on topics related to
      Technology, Media and Democracy and the trustworthiness of our information
      ecosystem. Our sponsors include Yahoo, Google, Facebook and the National
      Science Foundation. For prospective PhD students: I will only be
      considering new students who are committed to working on issues related to
      Technology, Media and Democracy. Feel free to email me with information
      about your relevant experience and goals.
